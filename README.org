 - [[https://clojurescript.org/][ClojureScript]] on the front end with shadow-cljs (see shadow-cljs.edn for options, dependencies)
 - [[https://luminusweb.com/][Luminus]] as a general application structure 
 - [[https://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] (and [[https://github.com/impossibl/pgjdbc-ng][Impossibl PGJDBC-NG Driver]] for async support as standard JDBC doesnt support it for PGSQL)

** Running
If you are going to be editing the UI or frontend at all, you should run
#+begin_src sh
npx shadow-cljs watch app
#+end_src
to watch can compile changes to the ClojureScript. You can read about using shadow-cljs [[https://gitlab.com/nikperic/lein-shadow/-/blob/docs/shadow-cljs.edn.md][here]] and [[https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html][here.]]

In another terminal window you should also run 
#+begin_src sh
lein run
#+end_src
to start the various back end components.
